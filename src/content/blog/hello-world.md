# Welcome

This is the first post on my new blog. I built this site with [Astro](https://astro.build) because I wanted something simple, fast, and easy to write for.

## What I'll Write About

Here are some topics I plan to cover:

- **Development** - Things I learn while building software
- **Design** - Thoughts on UI/UX and visual design
- **Projects** - Deep dives into things I build
- **Experiments** - Random things I try for fun

## Why a Blog?

Writing helps me process ideas and document my learning. Maybe something I write will help you too.

## Get in Touch

Have thoughts? Feel free to reach out through the links on the About page.
